I created two basic 2D games, "Pong", "Shooting".
It`s trainig to make me really understand single-threaded Game class,
so libraries used are just standerd c++-library and SDL2.
Still I don`t learn how to display string on SDL window, so Points and victory-or-defeat get displayed on Terminal.

If you want to play one of two, run this code

cd "path/to"/Pong_and_so_on/"one of them you want to play"/
make
./Main
