# Requirement
OS: macOS Big Sur version 11.2.1<br>
Programing Language: c++<br>
compiler: gcc version 10.2.0 (Homebrew GCC 10.2.0_4)<br>
â†’ make sure command "g++" call this compiler

# Installation
run this code in a directory you want to install this game.

git clone git@github.com:jinjinne0/Pong_and_so_on.git

# Usage
If you want to play one of two, run this code.

cd "path/to"/Pong_and_so_on/"one of them you want to play"/<br>
make<br>
./Main

If you run "make", and output error "Library not loaded....SDL..", install SDL by homebrew and try again.

## Rules
"Pong": Keep a ball bouncing around on the screen with by sliding a paddle on the left of screen. The more Time Pass, the ball and paddle acceralate. If the ball go off the screen, the game will end and the points you`ve got will be displayed on terminal.

Keyboard<br>
[A] start or restart the game<br> 
[S] pause the game<br>
[E] slide the paddle up<br>
[D] slide the paddle down<br> 

"Shooting": Make sure that any enemy(red dot) go off the screen through the shooter(yellow dot) by shooting it with bullets. Interval of enemy appering is 2 seconds. If a enemy go off the screen or collide with the shooter, the game will end and the points you`ve got will be displayed on terminal.

Keyboard<br>
[A] start or restart the game<br> 
[S] pause the game<br>
[E] slide the paddle up<br>
[D] slide the paddle down<br>
[K] shoot a bullet<br>

# Note
It`s trainig to make me really understand single-threaded Game class,
so libraries used are just standerd c++-library and SDL2.
Still I don`t learn how to display strings on SDL window, so the point get displayed on Terminal.
